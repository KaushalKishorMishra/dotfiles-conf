# procedure for adding .file in this dotfiles
- Step 1: Copy the .file to the dotfiles folder with its intended structure from home folder
- Setp 3: Change the .file name in the exisiting directory to something else(the symbolic link form this folder will create conflict in the next step)
- Step 4: stow . (creates a sybolic link for the files under this folder to the actual position)
(Optional:
- Setp 5: If error comes in the previous step it means that you havent changed the name of the files in orginal directory
        You can use this command to replace the .files contents from the actual file to this .file
        ## stow --adopt .
        this command rewrites the conflicting commands in the dotfiles folder with its orginal file contents
)
